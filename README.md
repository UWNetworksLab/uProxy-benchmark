uproxy-benchmark
=========

uproxy-benchmark is the repository for uproxy benchmark and testing tools.

### Overview

This repository is mostly a placehold for future benchmark and testing tools
development effort. There is one simple and dirty testing program written in
Python that works but far from perfection. 

The vision:

We need tools to stress test uProxy networking stuff for long period of time. 

We need tools to measure the performance of networking transporting through uProxy.

We need tools to provoke the limit of what uproxy client can achieve.

We need to measure above for:

   simpleSocks app in uProxy-networking

   uproxy app in browsers


Roadmap:

Existing python script can be improved to deal with large page set, and return 
meaningful statistic like bytes transferred, performance sacrifice in percentage
with uproxy routing.
 
Checking into Chrome telemetry (http://dev.chromium.org/developers/telemetry)
and see how can be benefit from that effort.
